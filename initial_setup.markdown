# Introduction

This document goes over the initial set-up of an analysis in R. This includes the use of a standard file organization system, R Projects, and Git. Structure may vary based on the specific type of project and analyses being conducted.


# File Organization

## Experiments

For experiments, every project should include four folders from the start: 1) "data", 2) "scripts", 3) "figures", and 4) "write\_up". All data to be analyzed goes in the "data" folder, some further folders may be necessary depending on the type of data. All scripts (cleaning, figures, statistics) should go in the "scripts" folder. Any figures should go in the "figures" folder. Any initial write-ups should go in the "write\_up" folder. Note, this does not include papers, just R Markdown write-ups summarizing work.

## Modeling

[to be added]


# Use of R Projects

All analyses should have an R Project based in the root folder of the folder structure described in the [section on file organization](#file-organization).


# Use of Git

All analyses should have Git enabled to allow for version control.


# Conclusion

This document was meant to set standards for initial organization of analyses in R.
