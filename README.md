# Introduction

These files form the CogStyle style guide for reccomendations on project managmenet and analysis. To see the full manual go to [CogStyle website](http://cogstyle.github.io). Below are instructions for collaborators.

# Making New Pages

All pages can be written in Markdown. To start a new page simple include

```
---
layout: component
title: "<title of page>"
---
```

at the top of the post. below the second --- put the rest of your post. When you are done be sure to save the file as ".md". If this is the main page in a section be sure it is called "index.md", otherwise feel free to name it whatever is appropriate. All posts will be changed to HTML format to display on the website.

# Section Headers

For now, start all section headers with a double "##" as in the example below.

```
## Introduction

Some introduction.

## Coding

Some coding.
```

At the moment the single "#" is reserved for the title. This will hopefully be fixed in the near future.
